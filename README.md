# SwinIR-SatRes: Satellite Imagery Super-Resolution

### Abstract

This repository presents **SwinIR-SatRes**, an adaptation of the state-of-the-art **SwinIR** (Image Restoration Using Swin Transformer) specifically engineered for satellite imagery enhancement. Unlike standard super-resolution tasks, satellite imagery presents unique challenges including massive file sizes (GeoTIFF), high-frequency texture details, and variable ground sampling distances (GSD).
