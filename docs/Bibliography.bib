This satellite imagery dataset enables research progress pertaining to four key computer vision frontiers.

Our data is collected from WorldView-3 satellites at 0.3m ground sample distance, providing higher resolution imagery than most public satellite imagery datasets. We compare xView to other object detection datasets in both natural and overhead imagery domains and then provide a baseline analysis using the Single Shot MultiBox Detector. xView is one of the largest and most varied publicly available object-detection datasets to date, with over 1 million objects across 60 classes in over 1,400 km\textasciicircum 2 of imagery.},

In vision, attention is either applied in conjunction with convolutional networks, or used to replace certain components of convolutional networks while keeping their overall structure in place. We show that this reliance on CNNs is not necessary and a pure transformer applied directly to sequences of image patches can perform very well on image classification tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train.},

  abstract = {Small object detection in UAV remote sensing imagery faces significant challenges due to scale variations, background clutter, and real-time processing requirements. This study proposes a lightweight transformer-based detector, MLD-DETR, which enhances detection performance in complex scenarios through multi-scale edge enhancement and hierarchical attention mechanisms. First, a Multi-Scale Edge Enhancement Fusion (MSEEF) module is designed, integrating adaptive pooling and edge-aware convolution to preserve target boundary details while enabling cross-scale feature interaction. Second, a Layered Attention Fusion (LAF) mechanism is developed, leveraging spatial depth-wise convolution and omnidirectional kernel feature fusion to improve hierarchical localization capability for densely occluded targets. Furthermore, a Dynamic Positional Encoding (DPE) module replaces traditional fixed positional embeddings, enhancing spatial perception accuracy under complex geometric perspectives through learnable spatial adapters. Combined with an Inner Generalized Intersection-over-Union (Inner-GIoU) loss function to optimize bounding box geometric consistency, MLD-DETR achieves 36.7\% AP50\% and 14.5\% APs on the VisDrone2019 dataset, outperforming the baseline RT-DETR by 3.2\% and 1.8\% in accuracy while achieving 20\% parameter reduction and maintaining computational efficiency suitable for UAV platforms equipped with modern edge computing hardware. Experimental results demonstrate the algorithm's superior performance in UAV remote sensing applications such as crop disease monitoring and traffic congestion detection, offering an efficient solution for real-time edge-device deployment.}

  abstract = {Transformer architectures prominently lead single-image super-resolution (SISR) benchmarks, reconstructing high-resolution (HR) images from their low-resolution (LR) counterparts. Their strong representative power, however, comes with a higher demand for training data compared to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). For many real-world SR applications, the availability of high-quality HR training images is not given, sparking interest in LR-only training methods. The LR-only SISR benchmark mimics this condition by allowing only low-resolution (LR) images for model training. For a 4x super-resolution, this effectively reduces the amount of available training data to 6.25\% of the HR image pixels, which puts the employment of a data-hungry transformer model into question. In this work, we are the first to utilize a lightweight vision transformer model with LR-only training methods addressing the unsupervised SISR LR-only benchmark. We adopt and configure a recent LR-only training method from microscopy image super-resolution to macroscopic real-world data, resulting in our multi-scale training method for bicubic degradation (MSTbic). Furthermore, we compare it with reference methods and prove its effectiveness both for a transformer and a CNN model. We evaluate on the classic SR benchmark datasets Set5, Set14, BSD100, Urban100, and Manga109, and show superior performance over state-of-the-art (so far: CNN-based) LR-only SISR methods.

  abstract = {Transformer-based methods have shown impressive performance in image restoration tasks, such as image super-resolution and denoising. However, we find that these networks can only utilize a limited spatial range of input information through attribution analysis. This implies that the potential of Transformer is still not fully exploited in existing networks. In order to activate more input pixels for better restoration, we propose a new Hybrid Attention Transformer (HAT). It combines both channel attention and window-based self-attention schemes, thus making use of their complementary advantages. Moreover, to better aggregate the cross-window information, we introduce an overlapping cross-attention module to enhance the interaction between neighboring window features. In the training stage, we additionally adopt a same-task pre-training strategy to further exploit the potential of the model for further improvement. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed modules. We further scale up the model to show that the performance of the SR task can be greatly improved. Besides, we extend HAT to more image restoration applications, including real-world image super-resolution, Gaussian image denoising and image compression artifacts reduction. Experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate that our HAT achieves state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.

  abstract = {Abstract             With constant advances in deep learning methods as applied to image processing, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely explored in single-image super-resolution (SISR) problems and have attained significant success. These CNN-based methods cannot fully use the internal and external information of the image. The authors add a lightweight Transformer structure to capture this information. Specifically, the authors apply a dense block structure and residual connection to build a residual dense convolution block (RDCB) that reduces the parameters somewhat and extracts shallow features. The lightweight transformer block (LTB) further extracts features and learns the texture details between the patches through the self-attention mechanism. The LTB comprises an efficient multi-head transformer (EMT) with small graphics processing unit (GPU) memory footprint, and benefits from feature preprocessing by multi-head attention (MA), reduction, and expansion. The EMT significantly reduces the use of GPU resources. In addition, a detail-purifying attention block (DAB) is proposed to explore the context information in the high-resolution (HR) space to recover more details. Extensive evaluations of four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the authors' proposed model in terms of quantitative metrics and visual effects. The proposed EMT only uses about 40\% as much GPU memory as other methods, with better performance.},
